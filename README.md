<hr>
- I was think, "Wow! my text editor is so ugly, wait i am a horrible programer why dont i make mine?", and thats how it started. This App is created to be a more Visual Appealing app, for now we only have Night/Day modes, However i wish to have more modes and ways to make your own custom note app.<br>
- Would love to have suggestions on what to do and how the app feels, still a long way to go, plan to update regularly adding more and more mechanics with a lighter and smoother performance.
